### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lv.1 beginner. I'm interested in computer vision and image processing. 

Iâ€™m currently learning basic python, Algorithm, data analysis and EDA.

after that, participate in Kaggle or Dacon to improve skills.

final goal is working out Machine Learning Algorithms in Autonomous Cars.

Thanks!
